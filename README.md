# 2048
A small clone of 2048, but with a 5x5 grid.  The existing versions i found didn't have the saving feature, and i got tired of closing in on 131,072 and needing to restart chrome, or accidentally hitting the space bar, or typing a word because i thought i was in another window and having it shuffle the board around...  so i removed the asdf and hjkl keys
